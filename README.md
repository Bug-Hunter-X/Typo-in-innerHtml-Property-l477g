# Uncommon HTML Bug: Typo in innerHTML

This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in HTML/JavaScript: a typo in the `innerHTML` property.

The `bug.html` file contains the incorrect code, leading to unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.html` file shows the corrected code.

This type of error can be difficult to find, especially in larger projects.  Always double-check your spelling when working with DOM manipulation.
